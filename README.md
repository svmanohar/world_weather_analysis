# Analysis of world weather patterns, as well as use cases of the Google Maps API and OpenWeather API

Here we use OpenWeather and Google Maps APIs, as well as Matplotlib, Pandas and NumPy to graph weather patterns and use linear regression to determine the correlation between latitude and various factors of weather.

The Vacation Itinerary and Vacation Search components allow users to specify a temperature range and receive an interactive Google Map figure with hotel names in cities which mach the temperature map.
